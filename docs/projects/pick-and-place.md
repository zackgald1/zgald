## Object Tracking and Robotic Control

This MATLAB program performs **background subtraction and object localization** for robotic vision control.  
After initializing a USB camera, the code captures a static background image and then detects any new object placed in the field of view.  
By subtracting the new frame from the background and applying a binary threshold, it isolates the objectâ€™s foreground pixels.

Using matrix operations, the script calculates the **objectâ€™s centroid** in pixel coordinates and converts it into **real-world millimeter coordinates** through calibration factors.  
A homogeneous transformation matrix aligns the camera frame to the robotâ€™s base frame, giving precise **X** and **Y** coordinates for control.

Finally, the script establishes a **UART serial connection to a PSoC microcontroller**, transmitting the computed position data for real-time robotic movement.  
The code concludes with a loop that continuously sends the position variables until the connection is cleared, enabling synchronized motion between the MATLAB vision system and the robotâ€™s actuators.
