## Summary

This project combines computer vision and embedded motor control to track a red object in real time using a camera and a microcontroller. The Python script identifies the target through HSV color segmentation and applies a PID controller to keep the target centered in the camera frame. Control commands are sent over UART to a C-based firmware, which adjusts two PWM outputs to drive the motors accordingly.

## How It Works

### Vision & Control (Python)
- Uses OpenCV to capture frames and isolate red regions via HSV filtering and morphological cleaning.  
- Computes the centroid of the detected region and calculates pixel error relative to the frame center.  
- Applies a **PID controller** to generate a motor speed command based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.  
- Implements anti-windup for integral accumulation and derivative smoothing (`d_error = 0.7 * last_d_error + 0.3 * d_error`).  
- Includes a **‚Äúsearch sweep‚Äù** mode to oscillate the motors if no target is found.  
- Supports real-time gain tuning from the keyboard (`u` and `d` keys adjust Kp) and auto-tuning recommendations using oscillation periods.  
- Plots error, speed, and time using live Matplotlib threads for control tuning visualization.

### Embedded Motor Control (C Firmware)
- Receives two UART bytes from the Python script ‚Äî one for direction and one for speed.  
- Automatically handles mixed packet order (determines which byte is direction vs. speed).  
- Converts received speed into PWM periods (`Period = 4 * Clock_Speed / Motor_Speed`).  
- Writes complementary PWM signals to control left/right motor direction.  
- Displays live direction and speed on LCD for debugging.
