## Why I’m a Great Fit

I’m a **hands-on engineer** who learns by building.  
From motor drivers and PCBs to camera-based feedback and full system integration, I take ideas from concept to prototype fast and clean.

I’m a great fit because I:

- Am a **hard worker** who takes ownership of challenges and sees them through  
- Learn **quickly** and adapt easily to new tools, systems, and technologies  
- Communicate clearly across teams and disciplines  
- Bring **leadership** and initiative to every project I’m part of
