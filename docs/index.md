# Zack Gald

**B.S.E. Robotics Engineering, Arizona State University (May 2026)**  
*Embedded Systems · Motion Control · PCB Design · Autonomous Robotics*

> I design and build reliable mechatronic systems—from firmware and drivers to the electronics and mechanics that make them move.  
> I thrive at the intersection of **hardware, software, and control**.

## Why I’m a Great Fit

I’m a **hands-on engineer** who learns by building.  
From motor drivers and PCBs to camera-based feedback and full system integration, I take ideas from concept to prototype fast and clean.  

I’m looking to join a team where I can:
- **Own real subsystems** in robotics or autonomy hardware  
- **Ship early and iterate**, balancing precision with speed  
- Contribute to **hardware–software integration**, embedded firmware, and motion control
